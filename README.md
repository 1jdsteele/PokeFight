# Pokemon Battle Game

## Project Description

This main goal of this project was to call an API using React. I took the liberty of ambiguity to recreate in an extremely pared down fashion the most financially successful video game franchise of all time: Pokemon. The foundation of the game in it's current form is simple. A user can input a Pokemon name or ID number to choose a Pokemon. A second user does the same, and a winner is announced. Both users are also given an opportunity for a suggestion of Pokemon.

## Tech Used

Javascript
React
Pokemon API
CSS

6. The "." on step 5 was important.
7. To open the file on your browser locally make sure that your last internet browser was not running in incognito mode as that disallows certain features.
8. To open the program on your browser locally type into the terminal: npm start
9. The most important components are within the src folder.
