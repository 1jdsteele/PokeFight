# Pokemon Battle Game

## Project Description

This main goal of this project was to call an API using React. I took the liberty of ambiguity to recreate in an extremely pared down fashion the most financially successful video game franchise of all time: Pokemon. The foundation of the game in it's current form is simple. A user can input a Pokemon name or ID number to choose a Pokemon. A second user does the same, and a winner is announced. Both users are also given an opportunity for a suggestion of Pokemon.
